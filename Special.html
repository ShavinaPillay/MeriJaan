<b>Everything</b> will work out eventually and sooner then later you will be cuddling with me in our big home, watching "How I Met Your Mother" , while eating popcorn, but the mushroom popcorn , which is the best popcorn, don't worry I'll explain in the car what's that.

There will always be bad days. 
<br>
Be calm.
<br>
Loosen your grip, opening each palm slowly now.
<br>
let go.
<br>
Be confident
<br>
Know that now is only a moment, and that if today is as bad as it gets,
<br>
understand that by tomorrow,
<br>
today will have ended.

You probably wondering, what is, <b>"My Person."</b>


<p><p style = "font-family:French Script MT;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;text-align:left;">
"The term <b>“my person”</b> originated from the show "Grey’s Anatomy." My own personal definition is the person you go to for everything, the person you can’t live without, the person you can’t stay mad at, and the person that supports you in everything that you do. Being someone’s “person” is a commitment. There is a very big difference between being someone’s boyfriend/girlfriend/best friend and being someone’s person. When someone is your person, you have such a deep connection."
