The both of us can relate to this quote because we never expected to have such a strong connection with each other. I believe we were bound to find each other somewhere, somehow in life but I know for a fact that i was meant to meet you because everything just feels so comfortable and at home when i am with you!
<br>
<p><p style = "font-family:French Script MT;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;text-align:left;">
You don't know this but before you, I use to wonder why can't I find someone that makes an effort me, wants to speak and communicate with me and want to spend time with me, to a point when I thought maybe I am asking for too much that why i cant find the type of person i want, then i met you, and  at that moment i realized i wasnt asking for too much, i was just asking the wrong people but the right person will make the effort for the person they want.
<br>
<p><p style = "font-family:French Script MT;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;text-align:left;">
I truly really like you and you mean so much to me baby! i honestly don't know how many one would ever take you for granted or treat you so bad, and it breaks my heart thinking about that because you are the kindest, sweetest, most funny, intelligent guy i have ever met and i wish i could just store you in my basement forever because you are so precious but I am happy those relationships didnt work out or else you wouldnt of met me!
<br>
<p><p style = "font-family:French Script MT;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;text-align:left;">
Everyday at 8:30pm , I get so excited for you to call and hear your voice, not to be gay or anything but your voice is more calming than Lavender but its not calming when you call me, "BiG hEaD!" , but i still like that nickname my little beetle.
<br>
<p><p><p style = "font-family:French Script MT;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;text-align:left;">
I am so grateful for meeting you baby and having you in my life, thank you for everything you have ever done and all the effort you made for me!
You are moon, my sun and my pain in the ass.
